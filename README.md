# IoT Robot with sensors
This repository contains the project of an Internet of Things Robot made with ESP8266 NodeMCU and BlynkIoT app. 
The sensors interfaced with the microcontroller are Ultrasonic distance sensor for smart braking and an LDR with a buzzer and an LED. 
For locomotion, the Blynk app was configured according to the requirement. 
The LDR sensor data is shown as an analog output on the Blynk app.
